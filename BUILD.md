# Build the application

## Prerequisites

* Node.js LTS or Latest
* Yarn (be sure to use the latest version, so that it can switch to Yarn 2 properly)

## Instructions

First, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `yarn build` to build the artifacts ready for deployment. If you want to watch changes and preview them, run `yarn dev`. This will instruct the Vite to open up a development server to preview the changes.
